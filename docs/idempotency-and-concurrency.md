# Idempotency, Replay & Concurrency — engine

Captures the design decisions and open questions around retry safety, idempotency, and concurrent access in the orchestration layer. Concrete reference is `src/use-cases/checkout/finalizar-pagamento-aprovado.ts` (the Phase 3 + Phase 4 process manager).

This is a **discussion doc**, not a settled spec — several deferred items below are real concerns that need their own plan eventually.

> 📌 **2026-06-03 — most cross-BC races eliminated by plan [0015](../plans/0015-contribuicao-pagamento-financeiro-collapse.md).** The simplification pass collapses three FSMs into one (only Pagamento has a state machine; Contribuição has none; LançamentoFinanceiro has none) and removes the contribuição-claim step entirely. The two races that motivated the deferred questions in the original draft of this doc — the **contribuição-claim race** (two visitors hitting "Comprar" milliseconds apart) and the **maturation race** (a scheduled job racing the webhook on flipping lançamento `status`) — are both gone:
>
> - **Claim race:** Contribuição has no `status` and no claim step. The "indisponivel" predicate is a query (`EXISTS pagamento WHERE idContribuicao = X AND status='aprovado'`). With no shared status to race on, there's nothing to optimistic-CC. Two visitors completing payment for the same slot inside the same Stripe-session window is an **accepted edge case** — both pagamentos go `aprovado`, recebedor receives 2x the value, no remediation, per 0015 §Locked-decision 6 (eunenem is a money-transfer product with no stock; double-pay is +money, not -inventory).
> - **Maturation race:** `LançamentoFinanceiro` has no FSM and no `maturaEm` field. The "states" are query-time predicates over `transferidoEm` + `canceladoEm`. There is no scheduled job flipping status; the admin sets `transferidoEm` manually when the money actually reaches the recebedor. Nothing races against the webhook because nothing is asynchronously mutating the row in the background.
>
> What *still* matters: the Pagamento FSM is event-driven (Stripe webhooks fire actual transitions) and earns its own consistency boundary inside the Pagamentos aggregate. The replay-discipline below still applies to `finalizarPagamentoAprovado`. The lançamento batch-transfer ordering is admin-discipline rather than a race (only one operator marks a batch as transferred at a time, with a UI confirmation step).

---

## Principle: idempotency is a domain invariant

> "Calling `finalizarPagamentoAprovado(idPagamento)` twice produces exactly one set of Financeiro effects — no matter how many times the caller retries."

Notice what this is NOT:
- ❌ "We dedup at the HTTP layer using an `Idempotency-Key` header"
- ❌ "The client must send the same request body to dedup"
- ❌ "We store the request hash and short-circuit duplicates"

What it IS:
- ✅ The **natural identifier of the operation** (`idPagamento`) IS the dedup key.
- ✅ The invariant lives in the **use case**, not in middleware.
- ✅ Any layer (HTTP, queue consumer, retry handler, manual operator) calling the use case twice gets the same outcome by construction.

**Why this matters in DDD:** if you push idempotency to HTTP middleware, the domain still has the bug — it's just hidden one layer up. The first caller to bypass HTTP (worker, batch job, admin REPL) re-introduces the bug. Putting it in the use case means *no caller anywhere* can violate the invariant.

---

## The current model: two replay paths in `finalizarPagamentoAprovado`

The process manager has **two crash points** between which a retry could land. Each gets an explicit replay branch:

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  finalizarPagamentoAprovado(idPagamento)                 │
│                                                          │
│   ① find Pagamento                                       │
│      ├── status === 'aprovado'  → REPLAY-1 (skip provider)│
│      ├── status === 'pendente'  → call aprovarPagamento  │
│      └── other (rejeitado/…)    → throw typed error      │
│                                                          │
│   ② fetch Contribuicao → Campanha (cross-BC join)        │
│                                                          │
│   ③ find existing lancamentos                            │
│      ├── exists → REPLAY-2 (return them as-is)           │
│      └── none   → call registrarEfeitos…                 │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Each replay path emits a distinct log event** (`checkout.pagamento.replay_aprovacao`, `checkout.pagamento.replay_financeiro`) so ops can tell which "leg" of the orchestrator a retry exercised. Useful for spotting unexpected retry patterns in production.

### Crash scenarios this handles

| When the crash happened | What the retry sees | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Before any work | Pagamento `pendente`, no lancamentos | Normal path — runs everything |
| After provider approval, before Financeiro | Pagamento `aprovado`, no lancamentos | REPLAY-1 + run Financeiro |
| After everything | Pagamento `aprovado`, lancamentos exist | REPLAY-1 + REPLAY-2 (full no-op, same result) |

## "Look before you leap" vs "Try and react"

Two valid designs for idempotent operations:

### Design A — Check + branch (what we chose)

```ts
const existing = await pagamentoRepository.findById(idPagamento);
if (existing?.status === 'aprovado') {
  // skip the provider call entirely
} else if (existing?.status === 'pendente') {
  await aprovarPagamento(...);
}
```

**Pros:**
- Reads like a state machine — every branch is named.
- No exception-driven control flow.
- Each replay path can have its own log event without parsing error types.

**Cons:**
- Extra round-trip on the happy path (an extra `findById`).
- Race window between `findById` and the action (see below).

### Design B — Try and react

```ts
try {
  await aprovarPagamento(...);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof PagamentoTransicaoStatusInvalidaError && err.statusAtual === 'aprovado') {
    // recover: load the existing pagamento, continue
  } else {
    throw err;
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- Smaller race window (the database-level lock during the operation IS the synchronization).
- No extra round-trip on the happy path.

**Cons:**
- Exception-driven control flow (some teams find this harder to read).
- Recovery branch couples to the *exact* error shape (`statusAtual === 'aprovado'`), brittle to refactors.

### When each is right

- **Design A** is what we used because in-memory is single-threaded — no race, the only payoff of "try and react" wouldn't materialize. Also Francisco is learning, and explicit state-machine code is easier to teach from.
- **Design B** is what we'd lean toward once we have a real database where the action itself takes a lock and the race window narrows to "between connection acquisition and transaction commit." There, the exception is signal, not noise.

---

## The race window — concurrency safety is deferred

The chosen Design A has a subtle race:

```
Thread 1:               Thread 2:
findById → pendente
                        findById → pendente
aprovarPagamento (ok)
                        aprovarPagamento (FAILS — status now aprovado)
```

In a single in-memory process this **cannot happen** (no parallelism inside one `node` process for awaited code, modulo cooperative scheduling within `await` points — and even there, both readers see the same map state until a writer runs).

In **Postgres + multiple workers**, it absolutely can. The fix is one of:

1. **Optimistic concurrency** — add a `version` column to Pagamento; the `UPDATE` checks `WHERE version = $expected`; if 0 rows affected, retry the orchestrator from the top.
2. **Pessimistic locking** — `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` at the start of the orchestrator, holding the row lock until commit.
3. **Constraint-based** — make the relevant table use `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (works for Financeiro's "no two lancamento sets for the same idPagamento") and check the row count to distinguish first-write from retry.

**Recommendation when we get there:** mix #1 and #3. Pagamento gets a version column (rare contention, optimistic is enough). Financeiro's `saveLancamentos` becomes `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` keyed on `(idPagamento, tipo)` — that makes duplicate inserts physically impossible regardless of orchestrator races.

**Why this is deferred:** there are no Postgres adapters for Pagamentos or Financeiro yet. Adding row locks against a non-existent table is yak-shaving. When those adapters are introduced (a future plan), this is the moment to harden.

**Post-0015 note:** the race illustrated above is the *Pagamento aprovação* race — webhook fires, scheduled reconciliação fires simultaneously, both read `pendente`, both try to flip to `aprovado`. This race still exists and the optimistic-CC pattern still applies (a `versao` column on Pagamento would close it). What 0015 retired was the *cross-BC* races — claim-race on Contribuição and maturation-race on LançamentoFinanceiro — because the columns they raced against no longer exist. The remaining races live cleanly inside the Pagamento aggregate's own consistency boundary, which is where they belonged all along.

## Compensation vs idempotency — different problems, different patterns

Easy to confuse. Two concepts, two patterns, two parts of the codebase:

| | Compensation (Saga) | Idempotency (Process Manager) |
|---|---|---|
| **When it applies** | Multi-step operation, one step fails mid-flow | Same operation called twice |
| **Direction** | Undo (reverse the writes that already happened) | Skip (don't redo the writes) |
| **Code pattern** | `try { stepB; stepC } catch { undo(stepA) }` | `if (alreadyDone) return existing; else doIt` |
| **Concrete example** | Phase 2: `iniciarPagamentoContribuicao` reverts the claim via `desassociarContribuinte` | Phase 4: `finalizarPagamentoAprovado` skips already-done steps |
| **Failure mode** | Partial state if compensation also fails (logged, ops investigates) | None — second call is structurally indistinguishable from first |

**The boundary in this engine:** Phase 2 (saga) lives BEFORE money moves. Phase 3 (process manager) lives AFTER money moves. After the provider returns "charged", you can't "uncharge" by compensation — you'd need a refund flow, which is a separate domain operation. That's why Phase 3 has no try/catch wrapping the writes: there's no compensation available, only retry-safety.

---

## Why we don't trust upstream not to retry

Networks fail. Queues redeliver. Users double-click. Workers crash and a supervisor restarts them mid-handler. The orchestrator must **absorb that reality** — it cannot demand the caller "be polite" about not retrying.

Concrete situations that produce a retry in this engine's projected future:
- HTTP client gets a timeout (server actually succeeded but response was lost) → client retries.
- A queue consumer processes a job, writes to the DB, then crashes before ACK → the queue redelivers.
- An operator runs the same admin command twice "to make sure it took."
- A scheduled job runs every minute checking for `pendente` pagamentos older than X seconds and finalizes them — could collide with the natural callback from the provider.

The orchestrator's job: make all of these safe.

## Open questions for future discussion

### 1. When do we need a real idempotency key (vs the natural one)?

`idPagamento` works as the dedup key for `finalizarPagamentoAprovado` because the operation is **about** that specific Pagamento. But what about operations whose "thing being done" isn't a single identifier?

Example: `iniciarPagamentoContribuicao` creates BOTH a contribuição-claim AND a new Pagamento. The caller-supplied `idPagamento` works — but what if the caller doesn't supply one? Then we'd want a client-supplied idempotency key.

**Open question:** do we adopt a `(idPlataforma, clientRequestId)` idempotency-key pattern for write orchestrators that mint server-side ids? Or keep "caller supplies all ids" as the convention?

### 2. How do we test concurrency once Postgres is in?

Today's "called twice" tests are sequential. Real concurrency tests need:
- Multiple processes/connections hitting the same row.
- Deterministic ordering (or property-based with many runs).
- A way to assert "exactly one winner; all others got the right idempotent response."

**Open question:** Testcontainers + multiple Kysely connection pools + `Promise.all`-driven contention? Worth its own helper library?

### 3. What about cross-aggregate idempotency?

`finalizarPagamentoAprovado` is idempotent per-pagamento. But what about a "process all pending pagamentos for today" batch job? If it runs twice, will it dedup correctly? (Yes today, because each individual call dedups. But there's an opportunity for the batch's *outer* loop to also be idempotent, e.g., recording "batch X already ran.")

**Open question:** do we adopt a batch-level idempotency log table once batch jobs exist?

### 4. Lançamento batch-transfer ordering ~~(was: Compensation's race window)~~

The original deferred question here was about the claim-saga's compensation racing against a concurrent claim. **Retired by [0015](../plans/0015-contribuicao-pagamento-financeiro-collapse.md):** no claim step, no compensation, no race. Marked answered.

The replacement concern at this layer is the **lançamento batch-transfer ordering** problem. When an admin runs `marcar-lancamento-transferido` over a batch of IDs, two questions matter:

- What if a pagamento estorna *while* the admin is mid-batch (one row already stamped `transferidoEm`, another still in flight)? The estorno's `canceladoEm` cascade should skip the stamped row (per 0015 §Locked-decision 10's 409 gate). The cascade uses `UPDATE ... WHERE transferidoEm IS NULL` so the ordering resolves naturally — but it's worth a test.
- What if two admins click "marcar como transferido" on overlapping batches in the same minute? The use case is idempotent (re-marking an already-transferred lançamento is a no-op per 0015 §Phase 2), so double-stamping is safe. But two operators racing on a recebedor's payouts is more of an **admin-discipline / UI-coordination** problem than a domain race — the UI should either lock the recebedor's "ready to transfer" list while a batch is in flight, or surface the contention as a confirmation prompt.

**Open question:** is admin-discipline (UI flow, confirmation prompts) sufficient, or does `marcar-lancamento-transferido` itself need a batch-level lock? Today: admin-discipline is enough because the operator population is small (one or two people) and the operation runs out-of-band. Revisit if the engine grows a self-service "transfer" surface that recebedores hit directly.

### 5. ~~The `version` column convention~~ — retired

The original deferred question was about retrofitting a `version: integer` column across all aggregates (Contribuicao, Pagamento, Lancamento, etc.) for optimistic CC. **Retired by [0015](../plans/0015-contribuicao-pagamento-financeiro-collapse.md):** Contribuicao no longer has writeable status, Lancamento no longer has a status field at all, and the question collapses to "do we add `versao` to **Pagamento** alone?"

That's a much smaller decision and it's the Pagamento aggregate's own concern, not a cross-aggregate convention. The webhook-aprovação race (illustrated in the race-window section above) is still the motivating case. The replacement open question:

**Open question:** when we add the first Postgres-backed Pagamento write, do we add a `versao` column on Pagamento up front, or wait for an observed conflict in production to motivate it? Today the webhook handler resolves the target pagamento via `findByExternalRef`/`findByPaymentIntentExternalRef`/`findByChargeExternalRef` (see aperture-wif8s) which is a single lookup point — adding `versao` is a one-row migration when we hit it. Recommend deferring until first Postgres adapter for Pagamento ships, then adding it in the same migration.
