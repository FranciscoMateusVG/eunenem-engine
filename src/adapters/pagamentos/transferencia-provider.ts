/**
 * aperture-vvh2j — `TransferenciaProvider` port (spec §3.1).
 *
 * The outbound PIX payout rail behind the repasse FSM. Mirrors the
 * `PagamentoProvider` idiom: business outcomes are RETURN-TYPED
 * discriminated unions (never thrown); only infrastructure faults throw.
 *
 * The real adapter (`provider.inter.ts`, aperture-ju5w2) speaks Banco
 * Inter's Banking API; `provider.fake.ts` is the deterministic
 * test/staging adapter.
 *
 * CONTRACT NOTES that carry the double-pay invariant (spec §6):
 *  - `referencia` is the caller-supplied STABLE reference, derived once
 *    from the repasse id and reused across every attempt. The provider
 *    MUST forward it to Inter unchanged so a retried attempt is the same
 *    payment identity, and `buscarPagamentos` can match on it.
 *  - `pagarPix` returning `agendado_aprovacao` is NOT success — it means
 *    the payment is parked in Inter's own approval workflow; the caller
 *    diverts the repasse to `verificando` and reconciles. Treating it as
 *    paid is the exact 1.0 defect this design forbids.
 *  - A THROWN error from `pagarPix` is ambiguous by contract (a payment
 *    MAY exist) UNLESS it is a `TransferenciaTransitoriaError` (below),
 *    which asserts no payment was created and is therefore safe to retry.
